# Imprint — Dual License

Copyright (c) 2025 John A. Long

Imprint is offered under a dual‑license model.  
A fully open GPLv3 license is available for all users, and a separate
commercial license is available for companies, organizations, and
government entities that require proprietary usage rights.

This model ensures:
- full open‑source freedom for the community  
- protection against proprietary forks  
- a sustainable path for long‑term development  
- clear commercial options for professional environments

# 2. Commercial License (Proprietary Use)

- using Imprint in internal business, enterprise, or government workflows  
- embedding Imprint in commercial products or services  
- offering Imprint as part of a paid service, SaaS, or managed platform  

The commercial license grants:

- the right to use Imprint in proprietary environments
