# Contributing to Imprint

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Imprint!  
This project follows a dual‑license model: GPLv3 for the open‑source
community and a separate commercial license for companies and organizations.
To keep this model legally clean and sustainable, all contributors must agree
to the terms below.

---

## 1. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

By submitting a contribution to this repository (code, documentation, or
other materials), you agree that:

1. Your contribution is licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0
   (GPLv3)** for the open‑source version of Imprint.

2. You grant the project owner a **perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide,
   royalty‑free right to relicense your contribution under commercial terms**
   as part of Imprint’s dual‑license model.

3. You retain the copyright to your contribution.

This ensures:
- the open‑source version remains fully GPLv3  
- the commercial license remains legally valid  
- you maintain ownership of your work  

No separate paperwork is required — submitting a pull request constitutes
agreement to these terms.

## 2. Code of Conduct

Be respectful, constructive, and collaborative.  
Imprint is built on transparency, clarity, and community stewardship.

Harassment, discrimination, or hostile behavior will not be tolerated.

## 3. How to Contribute

### A. Reporting Issues
If you find a bug or have a feature request:
- Search existing issues first  
- Open a new issue with clear steps to reproduce  
- Include logs or screenshots when helpful  

### B. Submitting Pull Requests
1. Fork the repository  
2. Create a feature branch  
3. Make your changes with clear, readable commits  
4. Ensure your code builds and passes tests  
5. Submit a pull request with a description of your changes  

### C. Coding Style
- Keep code clean, explicit, and readable  
- Follow existing formatting conventions  
- Add comments where clarity matters  
- Avoid unnecessary complexity  

Imprint values **predictability, safety, and teachability** — contributions
should reflect those principles.

## 4. Licensing of Your Contributions

All contributions must be compatible with:

- **GPLv3** (for the open‑source version)  
- **Commercial licensing** (for organizations that require proprietary use)  

Do not submit code you do not have the right to license under these terms.

If your contribution includes third‑party code, ensure it is GPL‑compatible.

## 5. Security and Safety

If you discover a security issue:
- Do **not** open a public issue  
- Email the project owner directly at:  
  **<your email here>**

Responsible disclosure helps protect users.
